# Binary Codec

This package contains functions to encode/decode to/from the [ripple binary serialization format](https://xrpl.org/serialization.html).

## Overview

XRPL nodes communicate using a compact binary format rather than JSON. Before a transaction can be signed or submitted, it must be serialized into this format. The `binarycodec` package handles that transformation in both directions.

**Encoding** converts a JSON transaction object into a canonical binary blob:
- Fields are sorted by a protocol-defined ordinal (type code + field code).
- Each field is prefixed with a compact header identifying its type and position.
- Variable-length fields (blobs, account IDs) are preceded by a length prefix.
- The resulting hex string is what gets signed and submitted to the network.

**Decoding** reverses the process, turning a hex-encoded binary blob back into a JSON object.

There are several encoding variants depending on the use case:

| Function | Use case |
|---|---|
| `Encode` | Produce the full transaction blob for submission |
| `Decode` | Parse a binary blob back to JSON |
| `EncodeForSigning` | Produce the payload that the private key signs (excludes `TxnSignature`) |
| `EncodeForMultisigning` | Like `EncodeForSigning` but appends the signing account ID |
| `EncodeForSigningClaim` | For payment channel claims |
| `EncodeQuality` / `DecodeQuality` | Encode offer quality (exchange rate) values |
| `DecodeLedgerData` | Parse raw ledger state data |

## Package Structure

The codec is split into three sub-packages, each with a distinct responsibility:

### `definitions/`

The schema registry for the entire codec. At startup it embeds and parses `definitions.json`, the authoritative XRPL protocol document, into a singleton `Definitions` struct.

The embedded copy is a verbatim snapshot of the `server_definitions` response of a xrpld node. Its top-level `hash` identifies that snapshot. Refresh it with the maintainer target instead of editing entries by hand, so the document keeps matching the network:

```bash
make update-definitions                                     # mainnet
make update-definitions NODE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5005/     # localnet
```

The target re-fetches `server_definitions`, unwraps the JSON-RPC `result` envelope, drops the request-scoped `status` key, and rewrites the file with sorted keys and two-space indentation, so re-running it against an unchanged node produces no diff. It also reports the version of the node it fetched from, so the snapshot can be traced back to a build.

The response covers everything the node's build can parse, not what its network has activated. Field and type definitions therefore land in the codec ahead of mainnet activation.

Everything the serializer and parser need to know about a field lives here:

- **`Types`** — maps type names (e.g. `"UInt32"`, `"Amount"`) to their numeric type codes.
- **`Fields`** — maps field names (e.g. `"Fee"`, `"Destination"`) to a `FieldInstance`, which contains:
  - `FieldHeader` (`TypeCode` + `FieldCode`): the binary identity of the field written into the encoded stream.
  - `Ordinal` (`TypeCode<<16 | FieldCode`): used to sort fields into canonical order before encoding.
  - `IsVLEncoded`: whether the field value is preceded by a variable-length prefix.
  - `IsSerialized`: whether the field is included in the encoded blob at all.
  - `IsSigningField`: whether the field is included when computing the signing payload (`EncodeForSigning`). Fields like `TxnSignature` are excluded here.
- **`TransactionTypes`**, **`TransactionResults`**, **`LedgerEntryTypes`** — numeric code mappings for each category.
- **`DelegatablePermissions`** / **`GranularPermissions`** — permission value mappings used for account delegation features.

### `serdes/`

Contains the low-level binary read/write primitives:

- **`BinarySerializer`** — accumulates bytes into a sink. For each field it writes the field header (via `FieldIDCodec`), an optional variable-length prefix (for VL-encoded fields), and then the raw value bytes. Appends `0xE1` as the `STObject` end marker when needed.
- **`BinaryParser`** — the inverse: reads a hex-encoded stream, decodes field headers back to field names, and hands off to the appropriate type deserializer.
- **`FieldIDCodec`** — encodes/decodes the compact field header bytes that prefix every field in the binary format.

### `types/`

One file per XRPL serialization type. Each type implements the `SerializedType` interface:

```go
type SerializedType interface {
    FromJSON(json any) ([]byte, error)
    ToJSON(parser BinaryParser, opts ...int) (any, error)
}
```

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `UInt64` | Fixed-width unsigned integers |
| `Int32` | Fixed-width signed integer |
| `Hash128`, `Hash160`, `Hash192`, `Hash256` | Fixed-length byte arrays for hashes and addresses |
| `AccountID` | 20-byte account address (Base58Check encoded in JSON, raw bytes in binary) |
| `Amount` | XRP drops (64-bit) or issued currency amounts (special 64-bit float encoding) |
| `Blob` | Variable-length byte array (VL-encoded) |
| `Currency` | 160-bit currency representation |
| `Issue` | Currency + issuer pair |
| `STObject` | Nested object; fields sorted by ordinal, terminated with `0xE1` |
| `STArray` | Array of `STObject` entries, terminated with `0xF1` |
| `PathSet` | Payment path data |
| `Vector256` | Array of `Hash256` values |
| `XChainBridge` | Cross-chain bridge descriptor |
| `Number` | Arbitrary-precision number (STNumber) |

`GetSerializedType(typeName string)` acts as the factory, returning the right implementation for a given type name from the definitions.
