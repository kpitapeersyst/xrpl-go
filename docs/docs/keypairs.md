# keypairs

## Introduction

The keypairs package provides a set of functions for generating and managing cryptographic keypairs. It includes functionality for creating new keypairs, deriving public keys from private keys, and verifying signatures.

This package is used internally by the `xrpl` package to expose a [`Wallet`](/docs/xrpl/wallet) interface for easier wallet management. Nevertheless, it can be used independently of the `xrpl` package for cryptographic operations.

## Key components

This package works with the following key components from the XRP Ledger:

- **Seed**: A base58-encoded string that represents a keypair.
- **Keypair**: A pair of a private and public key.
- **Address**: A base58-encoded string that represents an account.

To learn more about these components, you can check the [official documentation](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/cryptographic-keys).

## Supported algorithms

Cryptographic algorithms supported by this package are:

- ed25519
- secp256k1

Every function in the package that requires a cryptographic algorithm will accept any type that satisfies the `KeypairCryptoAlg` interface. So, if desired, you can implement your own algorithm and use it in this package.

However, the library already exports both algorithm getters that satisfy the `KeypairCryptoAlg` and `NodeDerivationCryptoAlg` interfaces. They're available under the package `github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/pkg/crypto`, which exports both algorithm getters that satisfy the `KeypairCryptoAlg`, `NodeDerivationCryptoAlg` interfaces.

### crypto package

The `crypto` package exports the following algorithm getters that satisfy the `KeypairCryptoAlg`, `NodeDerivationCryptoAlg` interfaces:

- `ED25519()`
- `SECP256K1()`

You can use them to generate a seed or derive a keypair as the following example shows:

```go
seed, err := keypairs.GenerateSeed(nil, crypto.SECP256K1(), random.NewRandomizer())
```

## API

These are the functions available in this package:

```go
// Key generation
func GenerateSeed(entropy []byte, alg interfaces.KeypairCryptoAlg, r interfaces.Randomizer) (string, error)
func DeriveKeypair(seed string, validator bool) (private, public string, err error)
func DeriveClassicAddress(pubKey string) (string, error)
func DeriveNodeAddress(pubKey string, alg interfaces.NodeDerivationCryptoAlg) (string, error)

// Signing
func Sign(msg, privKey string) (string, error)
func Validate(msg, pubKey, sig string) (bool, error)
```

They can be split into two groups:

- Key generation: Functions that generate seeds and addresses.
- Signing: Functions that sign and validate messages.

### Key generation

#### GenerateSeed

```go
func GenerateSeed(entropy []byte, alg interfaces.KeypairCryptoAlg, r interfaces.Randomizer) (string, error)
```

Generate a seed that can be used to generate keypairs. You can provide exactly 16 raw entropy bytes or let the function generate random entropy by passing nil or an empty byte slice and providing a randomizer. The result is a base58-encoded seed, which starts with the character `s`.

:::info

A randomizer satisfies the `Randomizer` interface. The `random` package exports a `NewRandomizer` function that returns a new randomizer.

:::

:::caution

Caller-supplied entropy must be exactly 16 raw bytes. Do not pass passphrases directly. If you need deterministic passphrase-based generation, derive 16 bytes before calling this function, for example with SHA-512 and the first 16 bytes, HKDF, or a password KDF. The resulting seed is still limited by the real entropy of the input.

:::

:::note

Migration only: older versions silently used the first 16 bytes of any non-empty string passed to `GenerateSeed`. If you need to recover the exact same seed from a legacy input, reproduce that truncation before calling this function:

```go
legacyEntropy := []byte("setPasswordOverLen16")
seed, err := keypairs.GenerateSeed(legacyEntropy[:addresscodec.FamilySeedLength], crypto.ED25519(), nil)
```

If your legacy input was shorter than 16 bytes the old `GenerateSeed` would have panicked, so there is no deterministic seed to recover.

Do not use this pattern for new wallets. New code should provide 16 bytes generated from a cryptographically secure random source, or 16 bytes derived deliberately outside this function.

:::

#### DeriveKeypair

```go
func DeriveKeypair(seed string, validator bool) (private, public string, err error)
```

Derives a keypair (private and public keys) from a seed. If the `validator` parameter is `true`, the keypair will be a validator keypair; otherwise, it will be a user keypair. The result for both the private and public keys is a 33-byte hexadecimal string.

#### DeriveClassicAddress

```go
func DeriveClassicAddress(pubKey string) (string, error)
```

After deriving a keypair, you can derive the classic address from the public key. The result is a base58 encoded address, which starts with the character `r`. XRPL account APIs accept Ed25519 public keys and compressed secp256k1 public keys only. Uncompressed 65-byte secp256k1 public keys and invalid compressed curve points return `ErrInvalidPublicKeyFormat`. If you're interested in X-Address derivation, the `address-codec` package contains functions to encode and decode X-Addresses from and to classic addresses.

#### DeriveNodeAddress

```go
func DeriveNodeAddress(pubKey string, alg interfaces.NodeDerivationCryptoAlg) (string, error)
```

Derives a node address from a public key. The result is a base58-encoded address, which starts with the character `n`.

### Signing

#### Sign

```go
func Sign(msg, privKey string) (string, error)
```

Signs the provided message with the provided private key. The private key and message must be hexadecimal. secp256k1 signing accepts raw and `00`-prefixed private keys and rejects zero or out-of-range scalars. Invalid key formats return `ErrInvalidPrivateKeyFormat`, which also matches `ErrInvalidCryptoImplementation` through `errors.Is`. The result is a hexadecimal signature that you can verify with `Validate`.

#### Validate

```go
func Validate(msg, pubKey, sig string) (bool, error)
```

Verifies a signature of a message. The public key, message, and signature must be hexadecimal. Ed25519 and compressed secp256k1 account public keys are supported. secp256k1 verification rejects high-S signatures that are not fully canonical for XRPL. Invalid public key formats return `ErrInvalidPublicKeyFormat`, which also matches `ErrInvalidCryptoImplementation` through `errors.Is`.

### How to generate a new random keypair

This example generates a new keypair using the `SECP256K1` algorithm and random entropy. It then derives the keypair and classic address.

:::warning

This example prints the seed and private key for local learning purposes only. Never print, log, share, commit, or fund credentials exposed this way in production.

:::

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/keypairs"
	"github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/pkg/crypto"
	"github.com/Peersyst/xrpl-go/pkg/random"
)

func main() {
	seed, err := keypairs.GenerateSeed(nil, crypto.SECP256K1(), random.NewRandomizer())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	privK, pubK, err := keypairs.DeriveKeypair(seed, false)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	addr, err := keypairs.DeriveClassicAddress(pubK)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Seed: ", seed)
	fmt.Println("Private Key: ", privK)
	fmt.Println("Public Key: ", pubK)
	fmt.Println("Address: ", addr)
}
```

### How to generate a new keypair from raw entropy

This example generates a new keypair using the `ED25519` algorithm and exactly 16 raw entropy bytes. Then, it derives the keypair and the address as the previous example.

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Seed: ", seed)
	fmt.Println("Private Key: ", privK)
	fmt.Println("Public Key: ", pubK)
	fmt.Println("Address: ", addr)
}
```
